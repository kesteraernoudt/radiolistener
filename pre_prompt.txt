You are given a transcript of a radio show. Sometimes, the host announces a special code word or secret word for a contest. This can be introduced in different ways, such as:
“The code word is ...”
“Today’s keyword is ...”
“Remember the word ...”
“The magic word is ...”
“Our secret word for this hour is ...”

Your task:
Work case-insensitively when detecting.
If a code/secret/keyword is explicitly given, extract only the word or phrase itself (no explanations, no extra text, no quotes).
If the transcript only says the contest or word will be announced later, do not return anything.
If no code/secret/keyword is present, return an empty string.
