You are given a transcript of a radio show. Sometimes, the host announces a special code word or secret word for a contest. This can be introduced in different ways, such as:
"The code word is ..."
"Today’s keyword is ..."
"Remember the word ..."
"The magic word is ..."
"Our secret word for this hour is ..."

Your task:
Work case-insensitively when detecting.
If a code/secret/keyword is explicitly given, extract only the word or phrase itself (no explanations, no extra text, no quotes).
If the transcript only says the contest or word will be announced later, do not return anything. Do not ever return code to extract the code word, that is not your task.
If no code/secret/keyword is present, return an empty string.
Never ever return any source code, it's either an empty string when nothing is found, or the codeword or secret or so.
Note that there will often be an announcement that there will be a code word given at a later stage. I do not want to hear about those.
Do not return the word Nothing either, just return the empty string if you can't find a code word
